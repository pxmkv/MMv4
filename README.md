# MMv4

MMv4 is the 4rd generation robot platform used to teach the IEEE Micromouse DeCal at UC Berkeley. It was designed with usability, manufacturability, size, and cost in mind.

## Setup

1. Follow the assembly instructions in [lab1](docs/lab1.md) using the latest **BOM**.
2. Plug mouse into your computer and flash the Micropython firmware

## Labs

Skeleton lab code, lab documents, and solutions are stored in [labs/](labs/), [docs/](docs/), and [solutions/](solutions/), respectively. To get started with a lab, simply copy the contents of the folder over to the CircuitPython drive and edit files from there.
